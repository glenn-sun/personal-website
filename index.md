## About Me

I'm a fourth-year Mathematics undergrad at UCLA. I grew up in New Jersey and am currently living in Los Angeles. This fall, I will be joining the CSE department at the University of Washington, where I will be a Ph.D. student temporarily advised by Paul Beame. My research interests will focus on proof complexity and formal methods.

I lead a class for high school students at the [UCLA Olga Radko Endowed Math Circle](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/) (formerly Los Angeles Math Circle). I work with other instructors to design a curriculum and teach fun topics in mathematics like knot theory, Axiom of Choice, and more. I've also TA'ed for the [AwesomeMath Summer Program](https://www.awesomemath.org/summer-program/overview/program-information/) (AIME/USAMO preparatory classes) and the [Program for Algorithimic and Combinatorial Thinking](https://algorithmicthinking.org/) (discrete math and algorithms).
