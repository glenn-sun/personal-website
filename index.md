## About Me

I'm a fourth-year Mathematics undergrad at UCLA. I grew up in New Jersey and am currently living in Los Angeles. My academic interests are in combinatorics, logic, algorithms, and complexity theory. I'm currently applying for Ph.D. programs in Computer Science, with concentrations in TCS and formal methods.

I lead a class for high school students at the [UCLA Olga Radko Endowed Math Circle](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/) (formerly Los Angeles Math Circle). I work with other instructors to design a curriculum and teach fun topics in mathematics like knot theory, Axiom of Choice, and more. I've also TA'ed for the [AwesomeMath Summer Program](https://www.awesomemath.org/summer-program/overview/program-information/) (AIME/USAMO preparatory classes) and the [Program for Algorithimic and Combinatorial Thinking](https://algorithmicthinking.org/) (discrete math and algorithms).
