## About Me

I'm a second-year Mathematics undergrad at UCLA, and I also take some classes in computer science for fun. I grew up in New Jersey and am currently living in Los Angeles. 

My academic interests are in combinatorics, logic, algorithms, and complexity theory, and I'm looking to get started with some research in these areas. I'm currently involved in a project on behavioral economics, which I joined to get a taste of applied research, but I think I'll end up still preferring theory.

I'm a lead instructor for one of the high school groups at the [UCLA Olga Radko Endowed Math Circle](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/) (formerly Los Angeles Math Circle). I work with other instructors to design a curriculum and teach fun topics like knot theory, Axiom of Choice, and more. I've also TA'ed for the [AwesomeMath Summer Program](https://www.awesomemath.org/summer-program/overview/program-information/) (AIME/USAMO preparatory classes) and the [Program for Algorithimic and Combinatorial Thinking](https://algorithmicthinking.org/) (discrete math and algorithms). 

Aside from mathematics, I am mostly a couch potato, where I watch K-dramas, anime, and play video games (currently osu!, Genshin Impact, and TFT). I also enjoy cooking a lot, but maybe that's just because I really enjoy eating too.
